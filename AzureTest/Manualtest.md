Planned manual testing for larger teams

Testing from within the Kanban board suffices when your testing needs are simple. However, for larger teams with more complex needs such as creating and tracking all testing efforts within a test plan scope, testing across multiple configurations, distributing the tests across multiple testers, tracking the progress against the test plan, etc., you need a full-scale test management solution and Azure Test Plans fulfils this need. Planned manual testing in Azure Test Plans lets you organize tests into test plans and test suites. Test suites can be dynamic (requirements-based-suites and query-based-suites) to help you understand the quality of associated requirements under development, or static to help you cover regression tests. Tests can be authored using an Excel-like grid view or other means available.
